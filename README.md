# Eject Volume #
Eject Volume is a small widget for the MacOS X Dashboard which allows you to eject all the active volumes on your system in a very handy way.
The widget lists all active disk images, external drives, networks shares or CDs and provides an eject button for each listed volume in order to eject it when the button is clicked.
